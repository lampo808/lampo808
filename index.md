Hello! I am Marco Lamperti, untenured Assistant Professor (RTDA) of Physics at [University of Insubria](https://www.uninsubria.it/hpp/marco.lamperti), and this is my personal professional page.

## Who

I am an optical physicist working across quantum optics, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. I love to apply physics (especially if it involves ultrafast lasers) to problems related to chemistry and biology. I am basically a [cat](https://twitter.com/ErrantScience/status/1443517386716557312?s=20&t=qZgHH1MQe_QfBP4PbLl_sQ).

## What

I was born (scientifically) at **University of Insubria**, where I graduated (BS, MS and PhD) in physics, working on quantum optic and fluorescence spectroscopy for biophysical applications, possibly combining concepts from both worlds. I then moved to the [COSMOS Lab](https://www.polo-lecco.polimi.it/ricerca/laboratori-di-ricerca/cosmos-lab-comb-assisted-molecular-spectroscopy-laboratory) of **Politecnico di Milano** in the beautiful city of Lecco for 5+ years, where I learnt to work with optical frequency combs to do ultra-accurate rovibrational IR spectroscopy. Applications ranged from fundamental physics to combustion.

In June 2022 I returned to Uninsubria, where I plan to integrate my expertise in IR/Raman laser spectroscopy and laser technology with the activities of the groups of Prof. Allevi, Dr. Bondani and Dr. Nardo.

Apart from research, I teach a [(hopefully) amazing course](https://www.uninsubria.eu/ugov/degreecourse/183377) where we explore the power of Python for real world data analysys problems.

## Why

What I love more of the academic environment is the contact with younger and older people bringing in their freshness and experience. I believe this is the soul of research, and I try to build a friendly environment around me, where diversity (of all forms: of thoughts, first) is valued.

If you want to give your contribution, feel free to stop by for a chat and a coffee.

## Where

I am waiting for an official office. At the moment, you can find me in the Tower building in via Valleggio, third floor, most probably in either of the labs _Fotofisica e biomolecole_ (Dr. Luca Nardo) or _Ottica quantistica_ (Prof. Alessia Allevi and Maria Bondani).
